# COS-Coding-Test

This is a coding exercise to test your skills in Intersystems Cach√© Object Script/Ensemble Frameworks. Please fork this repository to your GitHub page and commit your most readable and well organized "production-ready code". Here's the problem statement:

## Longest Palidrome

Create an Ensemble Production that will:
  1. Pick up a text file with a comma separated list of strings
  2. Find the longest palindromic substring of each string
  3. Store the resulting substring into a global indexed by the input string
  4. Write the substring results to a text file (one per line)
  
## Notes/Hints
* Use Ensemble concepts wherever practical (business services/process/operations)
* Our users to not utilize Ensemble to manage our application; we are looking for custom ObjectScript classes over business hosts with BPL/DTL logic 
* If you don't have your own instance of Intersystems Iris/HealthConnect to write your code, use the online IDE here:
